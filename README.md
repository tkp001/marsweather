Grade 9 Science Project, Distributed Monitoring Network for Mars Weather Exploration

My chosen project is to create a prototype to demonstrate radio communication using a problem scenario to capture Mars weather data for research purposes.

Imagine this scenario: Mark Watney and his team revisit Mars to continue their work. NASA researchers want to study Martian surface temperatures and humidity data over a period of time at multiple locations with unique physical/geographical features (e.g., craters, valleys, and plains) to better understand Mars's climate and weather patterns. For this, they need to design and build sensing devices that must be small and work in a Martian environment. Some factors to consider include weight, volume, and power requirements for the sensors. 


My project is a prototype which shows how data can be transmitted on Mars using a low-cost, energy-efficient Arduino based radio transmitter and receiver. The device can be modified for Martian conditions and is physically small for transportation and lightweight for easy deployment.


Mark sends the rover or Ingenuity Helicopter with a weather-sensing device to be placed at selected locations. The sensing device can be powered by solar panels until they lose their effectiveness due to dust storms. To minimize dust storm impacts, Mark will schedule sensing unit placement/maintenance during suitable seasons. The sensing unit will capture and transmit data in real time using radio technology back to the Mars Hab for further analysis. The same data is also transmitted back to Earth. This demonstration showcases the prototype that captures data and transmits it to another device via radio.
